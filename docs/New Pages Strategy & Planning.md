Great! Now I understand we're focusing on building new pages and skipping the payroll page. Let me create a strategic plan for the new pages we should build.

## ðŸŽ¯ **New Pages Strategy & Planning**

Based on our current EOR India page success and the Project Overview, here's my recommended approach:

### **Page Priority & Strategy:**

## 1. **Pricing Page** (`/pricing`) - **HIGHEST PRIORITY**
**Why First**: Critical for conversion, users expect transparency, builds trust

**Key Features to Plan:**
- **Tiered pricing structure** (Starter, Professional, Enterprise)
- **Feature comparison tables** (Us vs Wisemonk vs Deel)
- **Monthly/Annual toggle** with savings highlight
- **"What's included" accordion** for each tier
- **Add-ons section** (additional services)
- **Embedded Calendly** for custom quotes
- **ROI calculator** showing cost savings
- **FAQ section** addressing pricing concerns

## 2. **Contractor Management India** (`/contractor-management-india`) - **SECOND PRIORITY**
**Why Second**: Different audience (contractors vs employees), different pain points

**Key Features to Plan:**
- **AOR vs EOR vs Contractor comparison** table
- **Onboarding/payouts flow** visualization
- **Tax documents/compliance** requirements
- **Payment methods** and timelines
- **Contract templates** and legal compliance
- **Success stories** from contractor clients
- **FAQ section** for contractor-specific questions

## 3. **Resources Hub** (`/resources`) - **THIRD PRIORITY**
**Why Third**: Content marketing, SEO value, lead generation through gated content

**Key Features to Plan:**
- **Blog index** with categories and tags
- **Guides section** (gated PDFs for lead capture)
- **Glossary** of India-specific terms
- **Case studies** and success stories
- **Webinar recordings** and resources
- **Newsletter signup** with lead magnets

## 4. **About Page** (`/about`) - **FOURTH PRIORITY**
**Why Fourth**: Builds trust, team credibility, company story

**Key Features to Plan:**
- **Company story** and mission
- **Team profiles** with India expertise
- **Office locations** and local presence
- **Certifications** and compliance badges
- **Company values** and culture
- **Contact information** and office details

## 5. **Contact Page** (`/contact`) - **FIFTH PRIORITY**
**Why Fifth**: Essential for conversions, but can be simple initially

**Key Features to Plan:**
- **Single-step contact form** with smart routing
- **Embedded Calendly** for meetings
- **Multiple contact methods** (email, phone, chat)
- **Office locations** and business hours
- **FAQ integration** to reduce support burden

## ðŸ“‹ **Detailed Planning Questions:**

### **For Pricing Page:**
1. **Pricing Structure**: Do you have specific pricing tiers in mind, or should we research competitor pricing?
2. **Feature Differentiation**: What are our unique features vs Wisemonk/Deel?
3. **ROI Focus**: Should we emphasize cost savings, time savings, or compliance benefits?
4. **Custom Pricing**: Do we offer enterprise/custom pricing, or is it all standardized?

### **For Contractor Management:**
1. **Target Audience**: Are we targeting companies hiring contractors, or contractors themselves?
2. **Payment Methods**: What payment options do we support (bank transfer, PayPal, etc.)?
3. **Compliance Focus**: What are the key compliance requirements for contractors in India?
4. **Success Metrics**: What success stories can we highlight?

### **For Resources Hub:**
1. **Content Strategy**: Do you have existing content, or should we plan content creation?
2. **Lead Magnets**: What gated content would be most valuable (guides, templates, checklists)?
3. **SEO Focus**: What keywords should we target for India-specific content?
4. **Content Calendar**: How frequently do you want to publish new content?

### **For About Page:**
1. **Team Information**: Do you have team photos and bios ready?
2. **Company Story**: What's your unique origin story and mission?
3. **Local Presence**: Do you have physical offices in India, or are you remote-first?
4. **Certifications**: What compliance certifications or partnerships do you have?

### **For Contact Page:**
1. **Contact Methods**: What's your preferred way to receive inquiries?

## ðŸš€ **Recommended Implementation Order:**

1. **Week 1**: Pricing Page (most critical for conversion)
2. **Week 2**: Contractor Management Page (different audience, new opportunities)
3. **Week 3**: Resources Hub (content marketing, SEO value)
4. **Week 4**: About + Contact Pages (completing the site)

## **Questions for You:**

1. **Which page should we start with?** (I recommend Pricing)
2. **Do you have existing content** for any of these pages?
3. **What's your pricing strategy?** (tiered, custom, or hybrid?)
4. **Who's your target audience** for contractor management?
5. **What's your timeline** for completing these pages?

**My recommendation**: Let's start with the **Pricing page** since it's the most critical for conversion and will help us understand your pricing strategy better. We can then use that knowledge to inform the other pages.

What are your thoughts on this plan? Which page would you like to start planning first?
